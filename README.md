# Brunch app

This is a HTML5 template, built with [Brunch](http://brunch.io).

It's mostly just the Dead Simple Skeleton Brunch provides but with a little more folder organization.

## Getting started
* Install (if you don't have them):
    * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): `brew install node` on OS X
    * [Brunch](http://brunch.io): `npm install -g brunch`
    * Brunch plugins and app dependencies: `npm install`

* Run:
    * `brunch watch --server` — watches the project with continuous rebuild. This will also launch HTTP server with [Browser Sync](https://github.com/ocombe/browser-sync-brunch)
    * `brunch build --production` — builds minified project for production
* Learn:
    * `public/` dir is fully auto-generated and served by HTTP server.  Write your code in `app/` dir.
    * Place static files you want to be copied from `app/assets/` to `public/`.
